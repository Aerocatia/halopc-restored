# Known rendering bugs with Halo PC

This is an imcomplete list of known engine bugs related to the renderer, and are not caused by incorrect tag data.

## bitmap

- The `monochrome` bitmap format is not supported.
    - Chimera or Ringworld can enable A8 and A8Y8 as these are supported by d3d9, however A8 and AY8 are still unsupported. Ringhopper's bitmap command can force supported formats when making monochrome tags.
- Bitmaps encoded as `p8 bump` are not supported.
    - No fix.

## decal

- If the `framebuffer blend function` is set to `multiply` the decal will not render.
    - Fixed with Chimera.

## fog

- atmospheric fog does not render correctly.
    - Fixed with Chimera or CEnshine.

## lens_flare

- render size is tied to game resolution.
    - Fixed with Chimera.

## shader_environment

- Bumpmap lighting is broken.
    - Fixed with Chimera or CEnshine.
- Objects are rendered after fog (Custom Edition only).
    - Fixed with Chimera or CEnshine.

## shader_model

- The render ordering seems incorrect, causing the `detail over reflection` flag to appear inverted.
    - Fixed with Chimera.
- Objects can sometimes render overly bright.
    - Fixed with Chimera.

## shader_transparent_chicago, shader_transparent_chicago_extended

- This shader will fail to render if the `framebuffer blend function` is set to `multiply` while the `framebuffer fade mode` is set to `none`.
    - Fixed with Chimera.

## shader_transparent_generic

- Implemented in Chimera and ringworld.

## shader_transparent_water

- Mipmaps are handled incorrectly, causing water bump effects to fail.
    - Fixed with Chimera or Ringworld.

## unit_hud_interface, weapon_hud_interface

- Meters do not fade to another color.
    - Fixed in Chimera or Ringworld.
- Meter state blending is imprecise, causing pixels to be enabled when they should not be (and vice versa).
    - Fixed with Chimera.
- Multitexture overlays do not blend correctly.
    - Fixed with Chimera.
